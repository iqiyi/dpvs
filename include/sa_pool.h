 * socket address (or local <ip, port> pair) pool.
 *
 * for multi-core app, the traffic comes back of local initiated
 * connection need reach original CPU core. there are several
 * ways to achieve the goal. one is to calc RSS the same way of
 * NIC to select the correct CPU for connect.
 *
 * the way we use is based on Flow-Director (fdir), allocate
 * local source (e.g., <ip, port>) for each CPU core in advance.
 * and redirect the back traffic to that CPU by fdir. it does not
 * need two many fdir rules, the number of rules can be equal to
 * the number of CPU core.
 *
 * LVS use laddr and try <laddr,lport> to see if is used when
 * allocation. if the pair occupied it continue to use next port
 * and trails for thounds of times unitl given up. it causes CPU
 * wasting and the resource (lport) is not fully used. So we use
 * a pool to save pre-allocated resource, fetch the pair from pool
 * when needed, release it after used. no trial needed, it's
 * efficient and all resource available can be used.
