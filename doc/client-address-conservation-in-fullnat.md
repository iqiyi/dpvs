Client Address Conservation in Fullnat
---

The original client addresses are substituted by DPVS's local addresses in Fullnat forwarding mode so that auxiliary means is required to pass them to realservers. Three solutions are provided in DPVS to solve the problem -- toa, uoa, and proxy protocol, with each having its own pros and cons. The doc will elaborate on them.

* **TOA**

Client address is encapsulated in a private TCP option (opcode 254) by DPVS, and parsed into the connected TCP socket on realserver by a kernel module named [toa.ko](../kmod/toa/). By default, it requires no changes in realserver application programs for fnat44, fnat66. But an extra syscall to `getsockopt` with parameters `IPPROTO_IP` and `TOA_SO_GET_LOOKUP` is required for fnat64 to retrieve the original IPv6 client address from toa.

* **UOA**

UOA is the counterpart in UDP protocol. It supports two mode: IP option mode (ipo) and Private Protocol mode (opp). Client address is encapsulated into a private IPv4 option (opcode 31) in ipo mode, and into a private layer4 protocol named "option protocol" (protocol number 248) in opp mode respectively. Similarly, a kernel module name [uoa.ko](../kmod/uoa/) is required to parse the original client address from raw packets on realserver. Realserver application programs should use `getsockopt` with parameters `IPPROTO_IP` and `UOA_SO_GET_LOOKUP` immediately after user data reception to retrieve the original address from uoa. Note that not all kinds of network switches or routers support private IPv4 options or layer4 private protocols. Be aware of your network restrictions before using UOA.

* **Proxy Protocol**:
 
[Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/2.9/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) is a widely-used protocol for client address conservation on reverse proxy. It's been drafted by haproxy.org and supported two versions up to now. The version 1 is a human-readable format and supports TCP only, while version 2 is a binary format supporting both TCP and UDP. DPVS implements both versions and users can choose which one to use on basis of a per-service configuration. Moreover, DPVS allows for clients that have already carried proxy protocol data, which is often the case when DPVS's virtual IP is used as the realserver for some other reverse proxy such as nginx, envoy, or another DPVS, where DPVS doesn't insert client address by itself, but just retains the client address encapsulated in the packet, and makes protocol version translation if necessary. Proxy protocol has advantages of broad and uniform supports for layer3 and layer4 protocols(including IP, IPv6, TCP, UDP), both source and destination address conveying, no dependency on kernel modules, tolerances of network infrastructure differences. The client addresses are encapsulated into the layer4 payload in the begginning position. Application programs on realservers must receive the data and parse it to obtain the original client addresses immediately on establishment of TCP/UDP connection. The client address data may be taken as application data by mistake if not processed, resulting in unexpected behavior in your application. Fortunately, parsing the client address from proxy protocol in application server is quite straightforward, and a variety of well-known proxy servers have supported it. Actually, proxy protocol is becoming a defato standard in this area.

Next ,let's compare the three client address conservation solutions in detail in the following two tables.

The first table below lists the forwarding modes (FNAT44/FNAT66/FNAT64) and L4 protocols (TCP/UDP) supported by different solutions.

The second table details differences among toa, uoa and proxy protocol from aspects of functional features, configuraitons, application adaption and examples.
