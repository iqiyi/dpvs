# Introduction

`DPVS` is a high performance **Layer-4 load balancer** based on [DPDK](http://dpdk.org). It's derived from Linux Virtual Server [LVS](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/) and its modification [alibaba/LVS](https://github.com/alibaba/LVS).

>  The name `DPVS` comes from "DPDK-LVS".

![dpvs.png](./pic/dpvs.png)

Several techniques are applied for high performance:

* *Kernel by-pass* (user space implementation).
* *Share-nothing*, per-CPU for key data (lockless).
* *RX Steering* and *CPU affinity* (avoid context switch).
* *Batching* TX/RX.
* *Zero Copy* (avoid packet copy and syscalls).
* *Polling* instead of interrupt.
* *Lockless message* for high performance IPC.
* Other techs enhanced by *DPDK*.

Major features of `DPVS` including:

* *L4 Load Balancer*, including FNAT, DR, Tunnel, DNAT modes, etc.
* *SNAT* mode for Internet access from internal network.
* *NAT64* forwarding in FNAT mode for quick IPv6 adaptation without application changes.
* Different *schedule algorithms* like RR, WLC, WRR, MH(Maglev Hashing), Conhash(Consistent Hashing) etc.
* User-space *Lite IP stack* (IPv4/IPv6, Routing, ARP, Neighbor, ICMP ...).
* Support *KNI*, *VLAN*, *Bonding*, *Tunneling* for different IDC environment.
* Security aspect, support *TCP syn-proxy*, *Conn-Limit*, *black-list*ï¼Œ *white-list*.
* QoS: *Traffic Control*.

`DPVS` feature modules are illustrated as following picture.

# Quick Start

## Test Environment

This *quick start* is tested with the environment below.

* Linux Distribution: CentOS 7.2
* Kernel: 3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64
* CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v3 @ 2.30GHz
* NIC: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller 10-Gigabit X540-AT2 (rev 03)
* Memory: 64G with two NUMA node.
* GCC: gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)

Other environments should also be OK if DPDK works, please check [dpdk.org](http://www.dpdk.org) for more info.

* Please check this link for NICs supported by DPDK: http://dpdk.org/doc/nics.
* Note `flow-director` ([fdir](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/nics/overview.html#id1)) is needed for `FNAT` and `SNAT` mode with multi-cores.

## Clone DPVS

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs.git
$ cd dpvs
```

Well, let's start from DPDK then.

## DPDK setup.

Currently, `dpdk-stable-18.11.2` is recommended for `DPVS`. `dpdk-stable-17.11.2` and `dpdk-stable-17.11.6` are supported until the lifecycle end of DPVS v1.8.

> You can skip this section if experienced with DPDK, and refer the [link](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/index.html) for details.

```bash
$ wget https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-18.11.2.tar.xz   # download from dpdk.org if link failed.
$ tar xf dpdk-18.11.2.tar.xz
```

### DPDK patchs

There are some patches for DPDK to support extra features needed by DPVS. Apply them if needed. For example, there's a patch for DPDK `kni` driver for hardware multicast, apply it if you are to launch `ospfd` on `kni` device.

> Assuming we are in DPVS root directory and dpdk-stable-18.11.2 is under it, please note it's not mandatory, just for convenience.

```
$ cd <path-of-dpvs>
$ cp patch/dpdk-stable-18.11.2/*.patch dpdk-stable-18.11.2/
$ cd dpdk-stable-18.11.2/
$ patch -p1 < 0001-kni-use-netlink-event-for-multicast-driver-part.patch
$ patch -p1 < 0002-net-support-variable-IP-header-len-for-checksum-API.patch
$ ...
```

> It's advised to patch all if your are not sure about what they are meant for.

### DPDK build and install

Now build DPDK and export `RTE_SDK` env variable for DPDK app (DPVS).

```bash
$ cd dpdk-stable-18.11.2/
$ make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
Configuration done
$ make # or make -j40 to save time, where 40 is the cpu core number.
$ export RTE_SDK=$PWD
$ export RTE_TARGET=build
```

In our tutorial, `RTE_TARGET` is set to  the default "build", thus DPDK libs and header files can be found in `dpdk-stable-18.11.2/build`.

Now to set up DPDK hugepage, our test environment is NUMA system. For single-node system please refer to the [link](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html).

```bash
$ # for NUMA machine
$ echo 8192 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
$ echo 8192 > /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages

$ mkdir /mnt/huge
$ mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge
```

Install kernel modules and bind NIC with `igb_uio` driver. Quick start uses only one NIC, normally we use 2 for FNAT cluster, even 4 for bonding mode. For example, suppose the NIC we would use to run DPVS is eth0, in the meantime, we still keep another standalone NIC eth1 for debugging.

```bash
$ modprobe uio
$ cd dpdk-stable-18.11.2

$ insmod build/kmod/igb_uio.ko
$ insmod build/kmod/rte_kni.ko carrier=on

$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status
$ ifconfig eth0 down  # assuming eth0 is 0000:06:00.0
$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 0000:06:00.0
```

> Note that a kernel parameter `carrier` is added to `rte_kni.ko` since [DPDK v18.11](https://elixir.bootlin.com/dpdk/v18.11/source/kernel/linux/kni/kni_misc.c), and the default value for it is "off".  We need to load `rte_kni.ko` with the extra parameter `carrier=on` to make KNI devices work properly.

`dpdk-devbind.py -u` can be used to unbind driver and switch it back to Linux driver like `ixgbe`. You can also use `lspci` or `ethtool -i eth0` to check the NIC PCI bus-id. Please refer to [DPDK site](http://www.dpdk.org) for more details.

> Note: PMD of Mellanox NIC is built on top of libibverbs using the Raw Ethernet Accelerated Verbs AP. It doesn't rely on UIO/VFIO driver. Thus, Mellanox NICs should not bind the `igb_uio` driver. Refer to [Mellanox DPDK](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/mellanox-dpdk) for details.

## Build DPVS

It's simple, just set `RTE_SDK` and build it.

```bash
$ cd dpdk-stable-18.11.2/
$ export RTE_SDK=$PWD
$ cd <path-of-dpvs>

$ make # or "make -j40" to speed up.
$ make install
```

> Build dependencies may be needed, such as `automake`, `libnl3`, `libnl-genl-3.0`, `openssl`, `popt` and `numactl`. You can install the missing dependencies by using the package manager of the system, e.g., `yum install popt-devel` (CentOS).

Output files are installed to `dpvs/bin`.

```bash
$ ls bin/
dpip  dpvs  ipvsadm  keepalived
```

* `dpvs` is the main program.
* `dpip` is the tool to set IP address, route, vlan, neigh, etc.
* `ipvsadm` and `keepalived` come from LVS, both are modified.

## Launch DPVS

Now, `dpvs.conf` must locate at `/etc/dpvs.conf`, just copy it from `conf/dpvs.conf.single-nic.sample`.

```bash
$ cp conf/dpvs.conf.single-nic.sample /etc/dpvs.conf
```

and start DPVS,

```bash
$ cd <path-of-dpvs>/bin
$ ./dpvs &
```

Check if it's get started ?

```bash
$ ./dpip link show
1: dpdk0: socket 0 mtu 1500 rx-queue 8 tx-queue 8
    UP 10000 Mbps full-duplex fixed-nego promisc-off
    addr A0:36:9F:9D:61:F4 OF_RX_IP_CSUM OF_TX_IP_CSUM OF_TX_TCP_CSUM OF_TX_UDP_CSUM
```

If you see this message. Well done, `DPVS` is working with NIC `dpdk0`!

>Don't worry if you see this error:
```
EAL: Error - exiting with code: 1
  Cause: ports in DPDK RTE (2) != ports in dpvs.conf(1)
```
>It means the NIC count of DPVS does not match `/etc/dpvs.conf`. Please use `dpdk-devbind` to adjust the NIC number or modify `dpvs.conf`. We'll improve this part to make DPVS more "clever" to avoid modify config file when NIC count does not match.

What config items does `dpvs.conf` support and how to configure them? Well, `DPVS` maintains a config item file `conf/dpvs.conf.items` which lists all supported config entries and corresponding feasible values.

## Test Full-NAT (FNAT) Load Balancer

The test topology looks like the following diagram.

![fnat-single-nic](./pic/fnat-single-nic.png)

Set VIP and Local IP (LIP, needed by FNAT mode) on DPVS. Let's put commands into `setup.sh`. You do some check by `./ipvsadm -ln`, `./dpip addr show`.

```bash
$ cat setup.sh
VIP=192.168.100.100
LIP=192.168.100.200
RS=192.168.100.2

./dpip addr add ${VIP}/24 dev dpdk0
./ipvsadm -A -t ${VIP}:80 -s rr
./ipvsadm -a -t ${VIP}:80 -r ${RS} -b

./ipvsadm --add-laddr -z ${LIP} -t ${VIP}:80 -F dpdk0
$
$ ./setup.sh
```

Access VIP from Client, it looks good!

```bash
client $ curl 192.168.100.100
Your ip:port : 192.168.100.3:56890
```

We also listed some frequently asked questions in the [FAQ Document](./doc/faq.md). It may help when you run into problems with DPVS.

# Performance Test

Our test shows the forwarding speed (pps) of DPVS is several times than LVS and as good as Google's [Maglev](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub44824.html).
